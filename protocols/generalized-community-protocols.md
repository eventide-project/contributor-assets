# Eventide Community Protocols

The community is the most valuable knowledge resource supporting our efforts. It’s more instrumental than any of the documentation, training materials, or samples apps that help people understand and work with the tools and the architecture.

Protecting the integrity of the negotiation of meaning and the valuable relationships that make up the community is a key responsibility of community principals.

The following guidelines help community principals protect that integrity, and codify the standards that community members are held to.

## No Anonymity
Community members are expected to represent themselves in online media to the fullest extent possible of authenticity. Obfuscation of real identity is strictly proscribed. Community members are expected to use their real names in all media and communications. In media that have graphic avatars, community members are expected to use real photos of themselves. Exceptions are made in cases where a member’s safety is legitimately jeopardized without anonymity and obfuscation.

## Conflict
Conflict is a necessary element of negotiation of meaning. We hold conflict meaningfully, and as such it is a sacred process of the community.  Any action that harms the ability to hold meaningful conflict is strictly forbidden. Digressions into personal attacks will be scrutinized strictly for dishonorable conduct, and can lead to a community member being removed from community communication media as well as in-person gatherings.

## Predation
Harassment, persecution, predation, duplicity, negotiating in bad faith, or any form of exploitation or harm-profiting will lead to immediate banning from the community, and removal from all of its communication media.

## Expulsion
In the event that a decision is made to remove a member from the community, the removal will be implemented by the community principals. When possible and practicable, the community as a whole will be notified of any expulsion of a community member.

## Right to Participate
The community is open to all who want to learn and participate, and who are willing to hold themselves to the community standards. Community principals reserve the right to remove anyone from the community, its communications media, and in-person gatherings for any reason and at any time.

## Judgments
Judgments will be made by community principals, and will be made as open and transparent as possible and as practicable per the circumstances and conditions of any transgression or complaint.
