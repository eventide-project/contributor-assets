# Eventide Community Rules

The Eventide community is the most valuable knowledge resource supporting the Eventide project. It’s more instrumental than any of the documentation, training materials, or samples apps that help people understand and work with the tools, the architecture, and the mindset.

Protecting the integrity of the negotiation of meaning and the valuable relationships that make up the Eventide community is a key responsibility of the Eventide community leadership.

The following guidelines help Eventide community leadership protect that integrity, and codify the standards that community members are held to.

## Right to Participate
The Eventide Project's community is open to all who want to learn and participate, and who are willing to hold themselves to the Eventide community standards.

## No Anonymity

Community members are expected to represent themselves in Eventide online media to the fullest extent possible of authenticity. Obfuscation of real identity is strictly proscribed. Community members are expected to use their real names in all media and communications. In media that have graphic avatars, community members are expected to use real photos of themselves. Exceptions are made in cases where a member’s safety would be legitimately jeopardized without the anonymity and obfuscation.

## Conflict is Sacred: Our Code of Conflict

Conflict is a necessary element of negotiation of meaning. We hold conflict meaningfully, and as such it is a sacred process of the Eventide community.  Any action that harms the ability to hold meaningful conflict is strictly forbidden. Digressions into personal attacks will be scrutinized strictly for dishonorable conduct and can lead to a community member being expelled from the Eventide community.

## Predation

Harassment, persecution, predation, duplicity, negotiating in bad faith, the use of disparagement or digression into personal attacks in the course of technical and non-personal discourse, unethical business or personal conduct either inside of or outside of Eventide community spaces, or any form of exploitation or harm-profiting, will lead to removal from the Eventide community.

## Expulsion

In the event that a decision is made to remove a member from the Eventide community, the removal will be implemented by the Eventide community leadership. A member who is expelled or banned form the Eventide community will be removed or blocked from Eventide community communications media, and will be disallowed access to any Eventide community spaces, whether digital or in-person. When possible and practicable, the community as a whole will be notified of the expulsion of a community member. Eventide community leaders reserve the right to remove anyone from the community, its communications media, and community spaces for any reason and at any time.

## Judgments

Judgments will be made by Eventide community leaders, and will be made as open and transparent as possible and as practicable per the circumstances and conditions of any matter of Eventide community standards and protocols.
