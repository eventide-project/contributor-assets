# Eventide Issues Labels

The Eventide project uses GitHub issues to categorize work items in terms of their readiness for work, the appropriateness of the audience, and other descriptive and workflow attributes.

Each repository in the Eventide project's GitHub org uses the same set of labels, and uses them to convey the same meaning

## The Labels

### entry level

If you're looking to get involved in the Eventide project, items labeled with the entry level label are a good place to start.

These items are relatively straight-forward, and guidance and stewardship will be provided by project principals if somebody wants to try their hand at contributing to the project.

### consideration

The item is under consideration. It hasn't yet been determined that the work will be done. It's a potential improvement or feature, but needs more thought.

### feature

An issue labeled as a feature represents some new capability or functionality that will indeed be implemented.

### improvement

Unlike feature items, improvements don't introduce entirely new capabilities. They represent something that will be implemented to make an improvement or enhancement to existing capabilities.

### problem

Use this label to indicate a definite malfunction.

### mistake

This label is used to characterize something that was done in the past that should have been done differently, does not meet standards, and needs to be correction.

This label should not be used to indicate defects.

### suggestion

An issue with the suggestion label represents a feature or a change that you would like to have considered.

### declined

This label is applied to an issue labeled with "suggestion" when project principles have determined that the suggestion does not reflect current or intended design or standards.

### question

Label an issue as a question to indicate that the issue is a matter that you seek clarification for.

### critique

If you feel that a design should be challenged on its merits, use this label to categorize an issue as a critique.

In the words of Katsuaki Watanabe: Pick a friendly fight.

### materials

Items with the materials label represent work on documentation, examples, presentations, work shops, and the like.

### duplicate

A prior item exists or may exist for the matter addressed by the issue.
